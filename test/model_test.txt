------------------- EXACT SOLVER ------------------------

- node res constraint (exact solver):
    pre)
        - 4 nodes graph (star, 3 links)
        - equal cost for allocation (no preferred nodes)
        - chain length 3
        - only one resource
    1) not sufficient node resources for allocation of any node -> sol with no allocation
    2) 3 nodes with only one possible vnf allocation, 4th no allocation -> sol no allocation on wrong node
    3) 3 nodes with allocatation of 2 vnf possible, 4th no allocation -> node correctly reused in some solutions
 
- link bandwidth
    pre)
        - 4 nodes graph (star, 3 links)
        - chain lenght 3 (3 vnf)
    1) not sufficient bandwidith for allocation -> sol with no allocation
    2) all link offer possible allocation -> sol with allocation anywhere
    3) 1 link with no sufficient bandwidth -> sol with no allocation on link
    4) all link offer possibile allocation, one costs less -> cheap link always used
 
- link delay
     pre)
        - 4 nodes graph (star, 3 links)
        - chain lenght 3 (3 vnf)
    1) all links offer low delay -> sol with allocation anywhere
    2) one link with more delay than chain -> sol where link in not used
    3) one link in combination with any of the others more delay that chain -> sol where link is not used

------------------- DWAVE SOLVER ------------------------
test with node resource constraints shows that slack variables do not adapt to the solution,
and still provide penalty
